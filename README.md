Two-Player Quiz Buzzer with Lockout and 7-Segment Display

How It Works
This project is an electronic quiz buzzer system designed for competitive games where two players compete to answer first.

The system uses:
9V power supply
Two push buttons (Player 1 & Player 2)
Two SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) relays
Diode logic network
7-segment display
220Ω resistors

When a player presses their button:
The corresponding relay activates.
The relay locks out the other player (only one can win).
The winner’s number (1 or 2) is displayed on a 7-segment display.
The system prevents simultaneous activation.
Reset requires power cycling or manual reset.
This ensures that only the first button pressed is registered, making it ideal for quiz competitions, classroom games, or buzzer-based contests
